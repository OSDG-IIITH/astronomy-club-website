# Club Website Creation 

The website is built with Hugo. 

## Creating a site for your club

1. Go to the `content` folder and create a folder for your club. 
2. A sample club has been given, so copy all the files in that sample club to the newly created folder.
3. In every `_index.md` change the `type: club_name/` to one `type:your_Club_name/`
4. Go back to the root directory
5. Now go to `layouts` folder,
6. Cooy the sample folder given.
7. Rename it to be your club name. 

1. Cd into the content folder and copy the sample `club_name` folder. 
2. Rename it to the desired name. The path reach your clubs website now is `localhost:xxxx/clubs/club_name`. (xxx is your port number on the local machine. Typcially it is 1313 for this.)
3. `grep -r club_name` in the content directory and change every instance of it in your folder to that of your folder name

1. Go back to the root.
2. cd into `data` and copy the sample `club_name` folder.
3. Rename it to the same folder name you gaver earlier for content
4. `grep -r club_name` in the data directory and change every instance of it in your folder to that of your folder name
5. `team.yml` contains the memebers of the club, modify it accordingly.
6. `activities.yml` contains the list of major events your club does and gets listed in the homepage of your club. 
7. `event.yml` shows a list of events conducted and gets displayed as a gallery, on the events page. 
5. Modify the `title` and `type` in `event.yml` to reflect the events in `activities.yml`.


1. Go back to root. 
2. cd into `layouts` and copy the sample `club_name` folder and paste it in the same directory while replacing `club_name` with your club name.
3. `grep -r club_name` in the content directory and change every instance of it in your folder to that of your folder name

1. Go to `config/_default/config.toml`
2. Copy the `menu.club_name` section and paste it again.
3. In the pasted section replace the `club_name` with your club
4. Go to `layouts` and cd into your club directory, and `grep -r "header"`.
5. Replace every instance of `club_name` with that of your club name. 

## Deploying the site on the local machine 

1. We use, `Hugo` a static site generater to generate the website. 
2. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) 
3. Install the theme, instructions available [here](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo). 
4. Make sure to install the theme into the right dir, ```git clone https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo.git themes/kross-hugo-portfolio-template/   ```

5. Run `hugo server` to run the server on your local machine. Execute this command in the root directory of the project. 
6. If you have drafts, then run `hugo server -D` to view them. Do not keep drafts, and set the value to `False` when you're done as they do not get deployed on the site.  
7. Make sure to have the latest version Hugo installed. 

## Adding Content 

1. Run `hugo new event_name.md` in the `/content/your-club-name/archive`. 
2. All the content posts are written in Markdown, and you can look into the Hugo Documentation for more details.
3. Modify the `event.yl` file in the `/data/your-club-name/`, and add a picture for that event. 
4. Make a new entry directly below the old ones, and give it a picture, and link it to the event-post created in the archive section done earlier. You can do a hardlink if you want(site is deployed on www.clubs.iiit.ac.in/clubs/your-club-name), but preferably make it a relative link, with the link being `{{< ref "/your-club-name/archive/my-post" >}}`.
5. Add the relavant `type` for it. 
6. If you want to add more than one picture make a seperate entry in `activities,yml


## Modifying homepage 

1. Go to `layouts/your_club/index.html` and modify the files over there 
2. Go to `data\your_club\homepage.yml` and modify the Hugo variables from there. 
3. Make sure to go to `layouts/partials/club_name/header.html` and change the home path to your club name from `club_name`
The names and the rest are pretty self-explanatory. In case you don't like it, you are free to rewrite `index.html` however you like as a normal html file. 
6. Make sure to have the latest version Hugo installed. I'm currently running v0.59.1. 

## Adding events to your club
